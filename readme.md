Replace YOUR_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_ID in the action attribute of the <form> tag with the ID of a Google Apps Script endpoint that you configure to send form submissions to Google Drive or Google Sheets.
Add any missing images to the src attributes of the <img> and background-image properties.
Ensure your Google Apps Script is set to accept POST requests and stores the data securely. Let me know if you need help setting that up!
