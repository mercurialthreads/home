                <h1>Hi! üëã I‚Äôm Justine!</h1>
                <p>
                    Mercurial Threads is my creative outlet for exploring fabric dyeing & fiber art. 
                    Started back in 2013 in my laundry room, my passion lies in the process of this creative practice and honoring traditional techniques 
                    with a modern spin. I strive to apply this idea to all aspects of life!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now upgraded to a large basement & outdoor space, my home & studio is located in Jackson, Michigan, 
                    where I am cultivating a slow & mindful life with my partner & dog.

                        Each dyed piece is individually processed by hand using either low-impact synthetic dyes or plant-based dyes. 
                        Both chemical processes hold a place in my heart, and I am forever learning how to build a more sustainable creative practice 
                        and reduce my carbon footprint.

                        Through exploring the endless world of fabric dyeing, I am always brought back to the present moment. Fiber arts are a continuous practice in slowing down and honoring the process of the craft.  These ideas go hand and hand with my yoga practice and I am grateful to intertwine my creativity with my spirituality.

                        All of this is wrapped up into one of a kind, colorful, and mindful works of art for your beautiful body, surrounding spaces, and expressive soul.
